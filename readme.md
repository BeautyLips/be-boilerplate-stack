### Motivation

Get a basic example of setting up the environment,
see how different tools work together. Highlighting and error correction,
sorting css styles, file formatting, basic examples for error handling, routing,
data retrieval, working with pictures and icons, testing environment and much more.

### Description

The pack contains templates with examples and empty ones.
Linters are scheduled to run on a commit, you can call the command manually,
but it is better to configure the editor to automatically format when saving the file.
You will find more descriptions in readme.md or docs.md in the folder of each project.
